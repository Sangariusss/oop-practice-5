# Practice Work #5: Working with Collections of Objects

## Objective:
Acquire skills in creating collections and learn how to choose and use the appropriate collection implementation in the Collections Framework. Master the basic functions of working with collections. Familiarize yourself with Generics and the Stream API.

## Tasks:
1. **Performance Analysis of Java Collections:** Conduct performance tests to compare different types of collections and their typical functions, including CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, finding, concatenating, reducing, matching, counting, summing, and averaging.

2. **Result Tables and Sorting:** Display result tables showing the time intervals for each operation and sort them based on the best time performance.

3. **Large Data Tests:** Formulate tests with large data sets (50k, 500k, 1 million).

4. **Data Types:** Generate data from primitive data types and custom objects.

5. **Text Output Color Scheme:** Implement a color scheme for text output based on preferences.

6. **Utilized Collection Types:** Use a variety of collection types, including those that implement the List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces. Aim for a minimum of 8 collection types.

7. **Example Investigation:** Refer to external sources to gain insights into the subject area and formulate general theses for further exploration.

8. **Stream API Usage:** Perform all tasks using the Stream API.

9. **Successful Investigation Criteria:** Successful investigation is indicated by tests meeting the performance benchmarks outlined [here](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/data-structures-a-quick-comparison-6689d725b3b0).

10. **Parallel Stream Usage:** Repeat all tasks using parallel streams and showcase the results.

## Project Structure:
- **CollectionPerformanceTester:** Main class to initiate and conduct performance tests.
- **ListPerformanceTester:** Class for testing list operations.
- **SetPerformanceTester:** Class for testing set operations.
- **QueuePerformanceTester:** Class for testing queue operations.
- **MapPerformanceTester:** Class for testing map operations.

## How to Run:
1. Execute `CollectionPerformanceTester` to run the performance tests on various collections.
2. Review the generated result tables and performance analysis.

## Notes:
- Ensure that Java and the necessary dependencies are properly installed.
- Adjust the color scheme preferences in the code based on your preferences.
- Explore and understand the intricacies of the Stream API through practical applications.

## Conclusion:
This practical work aims to deepen your understanding of the Java Collections Framework, Generics, and the Stream API. Through performance testing and exploration of various collection types, you'll gain valuable insights into the efficiency and suitability of different collections for specific tasks. Additionally, the use of parallel streams will showcase the benefits of concurrent processing in certain scenarios.
